# FourBarStraightLineGenerators
This repository contains files to visualize an atlas of 274 four-bar straight line generating linkages found using a nonlinear optimization/regression approach based in numerical continuation. Linkage designs found via this approach are naturally represented in a nine dimensional space. These are visualized in a 2D space using the dimensional reduction tool, Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP)
